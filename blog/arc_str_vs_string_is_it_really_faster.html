<h1>Arc&lt;str&gt; vs String, is Arc&lt;str&gt; really faster?</h1>
<p>The short (and incorrect) answer is probably,
but that's probably not what we're looking for.</p>
<h2>What does &quot;faster&quot; even mean</h2>
<p>In this case we're talking about cloning performance, aka how long
it takes to call the <code>.clone()</code> function on the element.</p>
<p>In the case of <code>String</code> this means allocating a new string and
then <code>memcopy</code>ing the data over.
<code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code> by comparison simply increments the strong reference counter.</p>
<h2>Expectations</h2>
<p>You would expect a single increment to always be faster than a call
to <code>malloc</code> and then <code>memcopy</code>, since, that's supposedly a complex
call which should take much longer than the increment operation.</p>
<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p>TODO: FINISH THIS</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p><img src="/imgs/arc_str_vs_string_graph.png" alt="Chart showing performance differences between Arc&lt;str&gt;- and String-cloning" />
As you can see, our expectations where only fulfilled, when a single
thread accesses the <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code>. As soon as multiple threads are contending
for the <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code> we start having issues and the performance of <code>String</code>
surpasses the performance of <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code> significantly. Now the question
remains, why does it have much greater performance?</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>This information is based on <code>Jemallocator</code>, but may also be applicable to other multithreaded allocators.</p>
<p>Firstly, all references of <code>Arc&lt;str&gt;</code> refer to the same instance, which
means all clone operations operate on the same atomic integer, which as
I alluded to before causes significant lock contention. <code>String</code> by contrast
calls <code>Jemalloc</code>s <code>malloc</code> implementation, which uses thread-local arenas to
get around this.</p>
<p>Whats still unexplained is why <code>String</code> gets <em>slower</em> when we <em>dont</em> drop
the <code>String</code> after each use. This is simply explained by how <code>Jemalloc</code> allocates
memory. As you might already know allocating memory from the kernel on Linux
happens using the <code>mmap</code> syscall, which takes time. Therefore the allocator
attempts to call <code>mmap</code> as little as possible, by putting multiple allocations
into a single <code>mmap</code>ed &quot;bucket&quot;. Therefore, if we constantly <code>malloc</code> then
immediately <code>free</code> the allocated memory, we are always using just
a single <strong>thread-local</strong> &quot;bucket&quot; for our allocation, no syscalls involved!
If we instead leak the memory, the allocator now has to constantly allocate
new memory using <code>mmap</code>, which, while probably amortized using bigger allocations,
still takes quite a bit of time.</p>
